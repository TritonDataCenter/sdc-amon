# Amon (SDC Monitoring and Alarming)

*Note: This document is intended for an SDC operator or developer. End-user
docs for SDC monitoring and alarming are part of the Cloud API
documentation.*

Amon is a monitoring and alarming system for SmartDataCenter (SDC). It has
three components: a central master, a relay agent ("amon relay") in each
node global zone agents ("amon agent") in global zones and, eventually, in
customer zones and guest VMs. **Monitors** (grouping of probes and contacts)
and **probes** (things to check and alarm on) are configured on the master
(i.e. on the "Amon Master API"). Probe data is passed from the master, via
the relays to the appropriate agent where the probe is run. When a probe
fails/trips it raises and event, which passes through the relays up to the
master. The master handles events by creating or updating **alarms** and
sending notifications to the configured contacts, if appropriate (suppression
and de-duplication rules can mean a notification is not always sent). Contact
info lives with the user account in UFDS.

For external users (i.e. anyone other than an Amon developer), it is the Amon
Master API (or "Amon API" for short) that is most relevant. This document
also describes the (internal) Relay API.

Public endpoints of the Amon Master API are under a "/pub" prefix to
facilitate proxying to Cloud API. For example, the set of open alarms for an
user is:

    GET  /pub/:user/monitors           # Amon Master API
    GET  /:login/monitors              # Cloud API

Where ":user" is typically a user UUID. However, for convenience in
development, ":user" may also be a user's login string.

**Warning: Amon does no authorization (or authentication). That's up to Cloud
API.**


### Error Responses

If you get back any error code in the 4xx range, you will receive a formatted
error message of the scheme:

    {
      "code": "CODE",
      "message": "human readable string"
    }

Where the code element is one of:

* InvalidArgument
* InvalidHeader
* MissingParameter
* RequestTooLarge
* ResourceNotFound
* UnknownError
* any of the errors from <http://ldapjs.org/errors.html>

Clients are expected to check HTTP status code first, and if in the 4xx range,
they can leverage the codes above.

# Master API: Monitors

A monitor is the primary object for defining what and how to monitor and
who should be notified on alarms. A monitor holds a reference to
contacts to notify. A set of probes to run (e.g. check for N occurrences of
"ERROR" in "/var/foo/bar.log" in a minute) are added to a monitor.

## ListMonitors (GET /pub/:user/monitors)

List all monitors for this user.

### Inputs

* None

### Returns

An array of monitor objects. Keys are:

||name||String||Name of this monitor. This is the unique identifier for this monitor. It must be 1-32 chars, begin with alpha character and include only alphanumeric '_', '.' and '-' ||
||contacts||Array||Set of contact names that are to be notified when this monitor alarms.||

# Master API: Alarms

**Dev Note: Not implemented yet. Currently the Master just sends a notification
for every event that comes in from an agent.**

An alarm is a occurence of a monitor having identified a problem situation.
These APIs provide info on recent alarms for this customer. Closed alarms are
only guaranteed to be persisted for a week. I.e. this is mainly about showing
open (i.e. unresolved) alarm situations.

    GET  /pub/:user/alarms
    GET  /pub/:user/alarms/:alarm
    POST /pub/:user/alarms/:alarm?action=close

The point of an "alarm" object is (a) to have a persistent object to show
current open alarms (e.g. for Cloud API, Operator Portal and Customer Portal);
(b) for the master to handle de-duplication, i.e. avoid a flood
of duplicate notifications for a stream of events relating to the same
problem; and (c) to support the user suppressing notifications for this
alarm ("Yah, I know it is a problem, but I can't deal with it right now.").



# Master API: Miscellaneous

## Ping (GET /ping)

A simple ping to check to health of the Amon server. Here "pid" is the PID of
the Amon master server process. This is helpful for the test suite.

    $ sdc-amon /ping
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Connection: close
    Date: Wed, 02 Nov 2011 04:40:42 GMT
    Server: Amon Master/1.0.0

# Relay API

Amon employs a tree of relay servers for (a) ferrying agent probe data
from the master to the agents and (b) ferrying events from agents back to
the master. This is done via the Relay API. The Amon Master also implements
this API.

Dev Note: The module "common/lib/relay-client.js" is used by both amon-relay
and amon-master to speak the Relay API. In production usage the relays
speak to the master over a network socket and agents speak to their relay
over a Unix domain socket (zsocket).


## AddEvents (POST /events)

Sends one or more events up to a relay (or the Amon master). Agents run
the given probes and send an event when a probe test trips/fails.

TODO


## GetAgentProbes (GET /agentprobes)

Amon Relays periodically get agent control data (probes to run on a
particular agent) from the master. From there, agents poll their relay for
this control data.

Note: The returned probes are sorted to ensure a stable order and hence a
stable "Content-MD5" header to use for caching.

### Inputs

||machine||UUID||The machine (VM or SmartMachine, aka zone) for which to return probes.||
||server||UUID||The server GZ for which to return probes.||

Either `machine` or `server` must be specified.

### Returns

An array of probe objects, which contain:

TODO

### Errors

TODO


## HeadAgentProbes (HEAD /agentprobes)

This "HEAD" form of `GetAgentProbes` allows for relays and agents to check
for agent control data changes with less network overhead.

||path||Required||-||Path to the log file to watch.||
||regex||Required||-||Regular expression pattern to match against each log line.||
||period||Optional||60||Integer number of seconds. Time window in which `threshold` number of matches must be found to alarm.||
||threshold||Optional||1||Integer. Number of times a match must be found within `period` to alarm.||

# Glossary

- A "monitor" is a the main conceptual object that is configured by operators
  and customers using Amon. It includes the details for what checks to
  run and, when a check trips, who and how to notify ("contacts").
- A "probe" is a single thing to check (the atom of physical monitoring
  done by the Amon agents). E.g. "Check the running state of zone X." "Check
  for 3 occurrences of 'ERROR' in 'foo.log' in zone X within 1 minute." A
  monitor includes one or more probes.
- An "event" is a message sent from an Amon agent up to the Amon master that
  might create or update an alarm.
- An open or active "alarm" is the state of a failing monitor. An alarm is
  created when a monitor trips (i.e. one of its checks fails). An alarm can
  be closed by user action (via the API or in the Operator or User Portals)
  or via an Amon clear event -- the failing state is no longer failing, e.g.
  a halted machine has come back up.  An alarm object lives until it is
  closed.
- A "notification" is a message sent for an alarm to one or more contacts
  associated with that monitor. An alarm may result in many notifications
  through its lifetime.



# Use Cases

Some Amon use cases to guide its design and to demonstrate how to use
Amon. **Dev Note: Current Amon doesn't support all these use cases yet.**

In the examples below "otto" is an operator account commonly used
in dev work on Amon, "564d70d5-0187-e5d4-468f-7b49a6b014ff" is the headnode
UUID, etc.



## 1. Operator SDC Log Monitor

Probes for watching relevant SDC log files for, say, "ERROR".

    ...



## 2. Operator SDC Zones monitor

Probe for SDC zones going up and down. Separate from "SDC Log monitor"
because zone up/down alarms can clear.
See <https://stuff.joyent.us/stuff/trent/screencasts/amon1.mov> for a
screencast demonstrating this use case.

    echo '{
        "contacts": ["email"]
    }' | sdc-amon /pub/SOME-OPERATOR/monitors/sdczones -X PUT -d @-

    # Where 'ea3898cd-4ca9-410a-bfa6-0152ba07b1d7' is the ufds0 zone name.
    echo '{
        "type": "machine-up",
        "machine": "ea3898cd-4ca9-410a-bfa6-0152ba07b1d7"
    }' | sdc-amon /pub/SOME-OPERATOR/monitors/sdczones/probes/ufds0 -X PUT -d @-

    # ... one for each sdc zone (sdc-mapi /machines?tag.smartdc_role=*)
    # See "sdczones.sh" in <https://stuff.joyent.us/stuff/trent/screencasts/amon1-notes.txt>



## 3. Operator SDC Services monitor

Probe for SDC zones' and GZ's "smartdc" services going up/down.

    PUT /my/monitors/services < {
            "contacts": ["email"]
        }
    PUT /my/monitors/services/probes/$machine_alias-$fmri_nickname < {
            "type": "smf",
            "machine": "$machine_uuid",
            "config": {
                "fmri": "$fmri"
            }
        }
    PUT /my/monitors/services/probes/$headnode_hostname-$fmri_nickname < {
            "type": "smf",
            "server": "$compute_node_uuid",
            "config": {
                "fmri": "$fmri"
            }
        }

For example:

    sdc-amon /pub/otto/monitors/sdcservices -X PUT -d- < '{
        "contacts": ["email"]
    }'
    # Where '564d70d5-0187-e5d4-468f-7b49a6b014ff' is my headnode UUID.

## 4. Customer "Machine up" monitor

Probe for each of my machines going up and down.

Portal UX: This monitor is likely often wanted for *all* my zones.
However, don't want it on by default. Should portal's page after
"create new machine" have a big button (or a checkbox) to add this
monitor for this zone. Nice to have would be to offer checkboxes for
all monitors on existing zones: "You have monitor A on (some of) your
other machines. Would you like it on this one too?" Should portal add
a separate monitor? Or add a probe (or probes?) to the same monitor?
Probably another probe to the same monitor. Naming (of probe or
monitor) will be a pain, need to include machine UUID in the name?

Cloud API: You have to add these separately per-machine. That shouldn't
be so bad.

    PUT /my/monitors/machine-up < {
            "contacts": ["email"]
        }
    PUT /my/monitors/machine-up/probes/$machine_uuid < {
            "type": "machinedown",
            "machine": "$machine_uuid"
        }


## 5. Customer "Site up" monitor

Probe to "GET /canary" on the site from some other source location.

    PUT /my/monitors/site < {
            "contacts": ["email"]
        }
    PUT /my/monitors/site/probes/webcheck < {
            "machine": "$machine_uuid",  // <--- this is the machine to run HTTP request from
            "type": "http",
            "config": {
                "url": "http://example.com/canary.html",
                "method": "GET",
                "statusCodes": [200,201,204,401] // number or list of HTTP status numbers to expect
                "regex": "...", // (optional) check for a pattern in returned content
                "interval": 60,  // how often to check (in seconds),
                "period": 300, // alert window
                "threshold": 1 // # of times event must occur within the alert window before alarming
            }
        }


## 6. Operator `mdb -k` goober

Operator wants to run a particular "mdb -k" goober (Bryan's words) to run a
healthcheck on KVM.

    PUT /my/monitors/kvmcheck < {
            "contacts": ["email"]
        }
    PUT /my/monitors/kvmcheck/probes/foo < {
            "type": "mdbkernel",
            "machine": "$machine_uuid",
            "runInGlobal": true,   // must be operator to set this
            "config": {
                // This is essential wide open. That command can presumably
                // do anything.
                "command": ...,
                "regex": "...",   // check for a pattern in returned content?
                // Something to check exit value?
                "interval": 60  // how frequently to check.
            }
        }
