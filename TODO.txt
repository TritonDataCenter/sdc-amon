# immediate priorities

- get yunong up and running
- get this working in COAL
- a plan and schedule for January SDC.next release with Amon

# todo

- [Trent] clean up TODO.txt and README.md (they are too out of date)
    update README
- [Trent] :login -> :uuid
- [Trent] update https://hub.joyent.com/wiki/display/dev/SDC+Monitoring+and+Alarming
- [Trent] get working in COAL: Currently dealing with a problem of relay
  in coal not being able to connect to master running on my Mac.
- Idea: have amon-master create event/alarm to operator if it cannot connect/work
  with UFDS.
- update "zone" field to include CN uuid prefix: Because "global" is
  ambiguous with multiple servers (e.g. the headnode and a CN). Also
  should talk with Josh about whether this should use zone *name* or
  zone *uuid*. They can differ.
- "sdc-amon /pub/trent.mick" messes up on '.' in username
- [Trent] master/config.json.in and use that in usb-headnode/zones/amon/setup
- notification templating:
  - config.notificationsPlugins -> config.notifications.plugins
  - add config.notifications.templatesDir, there is a factory templates dir
    with defaults
  - handlerbars: is whitespace handled properly?
  - params for a template: notification type (e.g. email), probe type (e.g.
    logscan). So could have msg-email.html and msg-email.txt for fallback
    for 'email' notifications. Override for 'logscan' probes with
    'body-email-logscan.html' and 'body-email-logscan.txt'.
  - What about subject?  'subject-email.txt'
- 'sdc-amon /pub/hamish/monitors/whistle -X DELETE' fails
    ERROR: Error deleting 'amonmonitorname=whistle, uuid=7b23ae63-37c9-420e-bb88-8d4bf5e30455, ou=customers, o=smartdc' from UFDS: NotAllowedOnNonLeafError:...
- <probe>.idObject details on probe events from agent is *wrong*. Insecure.
  The userUuid value must come from relay (and should be the zone owner-uuid
  cfg var). Relay should probably also add the "zone" from which the event
  came? Relay should also validate that given event is for a probe that
  *exists* for that zone, if not then drop it.
- ticket for the system error twillio message (and retire twillio). What
  for actual SMS *text*?
- spec how processEvent should work with persistent alarms
- relay -D/--data-dir and create subdir
- consistent `new restify.FooError(...)` usage
- rm "joyent" from relay/agent dirs and socket paths
- [Trent] master: improve this log line to include user context:
    2011-11-23 21:36:37Z DEBUG: App.processEvent: contact 'email' notified
- relay: improve this log line to know which zone/zsock this request came
  from. Perhaps the "unknown" could be the zone name. Also perhaps "anonymous"
  could be the owner uuid (only if no cost to that).
    unknown - anonymous [23/11/2011:21:38:26 GMT] "HEAD /agentprobes HTTP/1.1" 200 0 1
- perhaps a "POST /pub/:login/contacts/:contact/test" for test notification?
- disallow '/' in name fields (so can use that as sep char for a string id).
  If this isn't acceptable then update id'ification in agent.
  Perhaps ':' would be preferable for id'ification? Meh.
- caching on ufds hits
- kill amon-common/constants.js:
    - separate ApiVersion btwn components. Because we should be able to
      use 'x-api-version:1' on the wire to have an older agent talk to
      a newer master.
- name fields in Master API: percent escaping
- suppression facility: global, per monitor, per customer? "per customer"
  could be implemented client side: portal/adminui just sets it for all
  that customer's monitors (looses mixed suppression states).
- tack on amon records to ufds/tools/genldif
- upgrade plan: What if UFDS schema needs to change? How do we rev the Master
  with older agents in the wild.
- restore this original sorta-schema for events from Mark?
      The (sort of) schema for sending a status update:
      
          {
            "status": "<STATUS>",
            "message": "Free Form String.",
            "metrics": [{
              "name": "<URN>",
              "type": <TYPE>",
              "value": <VALUE>
            }];
          }
      
      Where:
      
      * <STATUS>: A string, that must be one of `"ok", "warn", "error"`.
      * <URN>: The name of the check (note this will be validated against :check).
        An example is something like `urn:cpu:load`.
      * <TYPE>: One of `"String", "Integer", "Boolean", "Float"`
      * <VALUE>: Value for this metric.  Must correspond to `type`.
      
      If not obvious, you can send multiple metrics per check.

# Notes (possibly out of date)

## use case: operator wants an alert for every zone fault

- FMA-based check in amon-agent in all CN GZs
  Q: Ask rm how to trigger that FMA event.
- Q: Exclude explicit reboots? What about an explicit reboot, but it doesn't
  come back up?
  A: Yes, exclude for now.
- Q: how to handle clearing an alarm. Does FMA give me an event for that?
  Ditto for non-fma-based zone status watching? Are we going to send an
  amon event for *every* zone running state every minute? No way.

## old TODOs for MVP

Trent needs to filter this into the above TODOs.

- Build/install (usb-headnode, bamboo, mountain-gorilla):
  - riak: discuss with others if separate riak clusters for separate apps
    or one shared one? billing/amon/hostrouter(?)/capi
  - master
  - relay (SMF packaging done; bamboo started)
  - agent
  - package.json: get specific about included versions
- Retry/backoff everywhere: Restify-client supports everything needed here?
- event on zone/vm transitions: use zwatch
  - what does it mean to design to have events coming NOT from amon-agent
- Garbage collection of /events and orphans
- in riak, use uuid instead of customer_name for keys, if possible
- load testing (hook into mock cloud for this?)
  - estimate of design-limit on number of watches/notifications/events
  - e.g., what would it be on no.de
  - capacity planning:
    - http://wiki.basho.com/Cluster-Capacity-Planning.html
    - shared riak cluster with billing and ufds
    - http://wiki.basho.com/Bitcask-Capacity-Planning.html
- upgrade plan and testing
  - versioning (see ca/Makefile, and 1.0.0 instead of 6.1)
  - config handling
- headnode GZ cronjob that emails the /usbkey/config'd admin if amon and/or
  redis zones are down themselves.
- redis zone config: have "save 60 1". Make sure that isn't filling up disk
  with lots of snapshots. I *presume* this is just one or two files on
  disk, but should check.
- test: test how events are handled when redis runs out of memory
  Might want "maxmemory" and "maxmemory-policy ..." or "vm-enabled yes" in
  redis.conf


## Trent's scratch area

- upgrade deps/node and deps/npm versions to latest
- faking an event (calling Relay API):
    $ bin/amon-relay-api /events -X POST -d @-
    {"check":"joyent_whistle","status":"error","metrics":{"name":"amon:logscan","type":"Integer","value":2,"data":{"match":"i hear a tweet from someone"}}}
    ^D
- too much noise in the log: can't have the logs grow this fast
  don't log normal "HEAD /config" hits
- suppressing some zone transition events: How?
  - the start + reboot for zone provisioning:
    - talk with Orlando about a "ready" zoneconfig var set by provisioner
  - the stop/start of an intentional reboot (by an operator at the GZ
    command line)
    - sdc-amon-suppress ...   # or some command line that
  - intentional reboot or shutdown in adminui
    - either adminui or mapi's shutdown/reboot command would call Amon
      API to suppress?
    - or this is a separate action in adminui to manually suppress
  - intentional reboot or shutdown in portal/cloudapi
    - if MAPI above, then this is done.
  - intentional reboot of the *compute node* for maintenance by operator
    - sdc-amon-suppress command, and/or equivalent in adminui UI.
  - sdc-amon-suppress:
    - one shot?
    - toggle?
    - what is scope? Low-level: per zone name and per monitor name. Optionally
      just per monitor name for all applicable zones?
        "Suppress this monitor [until enabled again later]."
        "Suppress this monitor for machines X, Y and Z."
        "Suppress all monitors for machines X, Y and Z."
      Or is this only about suppressing *alarms*? I.e. only at the master-level.
      Yes.
        "Suppress alarms for monitors M and N [until enabled again later]."
        "Suppress alarms for monitor M for N for machines X, Y, and Z."
        "... for the next hour."
      general:
        "Suppress alarms
          for monitors M and N (or all)
          for machines X, Y and Z (or all)
          for a certain amount of time (or until re-enabled)."
        
- running on smartos global zone:
  devrun.sh: USE_ZSOCK=1
- /config -> /zonechecks
- use "/customers" prefix instead of "/pub" for Master API.
  


## Mark's old old TODOs/RFEs

Trent to filter this into above lists.

- CA Agent Plugin
- HTTP Agent Plugin
- revive twillio notification backend as "sms"
- Default to CAPI lookup user email on no contacts
- missing data alarms in master: ???
- edge-triggered alarms in master for checks: ???
- /events cleanup (look like other master apis)
- client SDK
- s/joyent/sdc/ in various runtime files and dirs
- Admin UI
- amon client: just integrate into node-smartdc?
- snmp (MarkC: "snmp traps". Me: What's that?)
- Interesting services for hooking into. Messaging services that might be useful:
    - http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/
    - https://www.cloudkick.com/
    - http://www.splunk.com/
    - http://www.pagerduty.com/
